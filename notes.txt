NN: best for non-linear relationships
    MLPClassifier
    Hyperparam tuning
    Unpredictable initialization makes the curve move a lot
    A lot more false positives on train but not on test
    Very balanced

DT: Min samples Split and Leaf are small
    Train loss remained low but test started high, more train data pls
    Larger diff between train and test
